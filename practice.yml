# Ansible Playbooks
# You are assigned a task to restart a number of servers in a particular sequence. The sequence and the commands to be used are given below. 
# Note that the commands should be run on respective servers only. Refer to the inventory file and update the playbook to create the below sequence.

# Note: Use the description below to name the plays and tasks.

# Stop the web services on web server nodes - service httpd stop
# Shutdown the database services on db server nodes - service mysql stop
# Restart all servers (web and db) at once - /sbin/shutdown -r
# Start the database services on db server nodes - service mysql start
# Start the web services on web server nodes - service httpd start
# Warning: Do not use this playbook in a real setup. There are better ways to do these actions. This is only for simple practise.
